They’re great when you go camping or swagging as they’ve got quilt lining in the inside so they’re absolutely warm as toast when she’s about minus 2. 

There are handy pockets galore in this jacket and there’s also a couple of pockets on the side to keep the mitts warm. 

Another great thing about this jacket is you can whack it in the washing machine to keep it nice and clean. You beauty!

    description: `The original cotton drill work pant – one of my favourites. 

I’ve been wearing these guys for years. I love the fact that they’re comfortable, and they’re pretty stylish as well. 

They have a new innovation – the old velcro-tipped phone pocket on the side. It’s got seven belt buckles here, because I like to wear a belt to keep the strides up, and they’ve got the angled pockets on the sides to keep the mitts warm in the middle of winter when you’re working out on site. 

These are a cracker.
